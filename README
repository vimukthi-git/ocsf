The assignment is done as a maven project containing three modules,

 - ocsf - this module contains the ocsf framework classes.
 - ocsf-simplechatserver - this module contains the chat server code.
 - ocsf-simplechatclient - this module contains the chat client code.

Execute
=======
The two executable jars for the server and the client are already built and stored in bin directory. You can run them with,
java -jar bin/<executable-jar-name>


Build from source
=================

To build the projects from source code first run,

mvn install

From the base directory.

Then run,

compile assembly:single

from within each of ocsf-simplechatserver and ocsf-simplechatclient directories. This will build the executable jars within target directories of each maven project.
